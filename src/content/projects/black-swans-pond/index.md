I want to build the largest fenced black swans pond in the world.

## Benefits

- I can pet the swans every day.
- Pets will have a large impact.
- It's highly improbable that swans escape.
- The turkey will be jealous. (But only for a thousand days.)

## Costs

- The fence is expensive.
- The black swans are pretty rare.
- I should consider buying grey swans. They are a good tradeoff between the balckness and the rarity.
