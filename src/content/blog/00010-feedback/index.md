I've realized that my mind is playing tricks. (I'm probably not the only one, but I will focus on my experience).

I always said that I gladly accepted any feedback, and I incentivized everyone to give me feedback. But what I've experienced so far is that feedback can be negative, stupid, or unproductive.

I don't react as well as I wish I'd do to negative feedback. Even though they are the most needed, my brain still distance itself from the comments. I will work hard to keep my mind aligned and ready to collect negative feedback. Disavowing negative feedback will slow down my progress.

Stupid/unproductive feedback is a waste of time. Instead of inviting everyone to give me feedback, I will try to understand others' opinions of my work based on their reactions and behavior. I'm aware that I have biases. I must avoid these biases that will otherwise nullify formative and productive feedback.
