[Sooo this is love </br> Sooo this is what makes life divine </br> I'm all aglow, mm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz4YaMr1rlo) ðŸŽ¶

Iâ€™m in love.

Sometimes, I sing when I write my posts. Usually, the mood of the song is not related to the topic. I like some trap music as background. While writing this post, Iâ€™m mourning this sweet melody with my mouth closed. The high notes are full of love. (Being this good of a singer must be phenomenal. I will definitely be singing to myself all the time I could)

The melody sounds flowy. It comes from my heart. I wish she could hear it.

Maybe that's where problems begin. I wish she could hear it.
This phrase perfectly sums me up. It portrays me as someone hidden behind an unrecognizable pseudonym, fumbling up my chances of bonding because I feel I may be misunderstood.

And yet I dance. The music gently caresses my dancing limbs. I'm happily dreaming. Dreaming costs nothing. She can't refuse me a dance in the moonlight. Everything's perfect, and nothing can go sideways. Yet it will remain a dream forever. The sweetest candy with the consistency of a cloud.

Is it delicious? No, it's just the brain imagining the taste, you aren't eating anything. And I'm hungry.

Why does it feel like so? Damn it. I'm hungry to tell her. Yet I fear that expressing my intentions will make her flinch. And she may start drifting afar and our paths will never merge.

Instead of intentions, I'd rather express emotions. Maybe music works in my favor.
