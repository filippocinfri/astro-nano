[Sooo this is love </br> Sooo this is what makes life divine </br> I'm all aglow, mm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz4YaMr1rlo) ðŸŽ¶

I am in love.

I am mourning this sweet melody with my mouth closed while writing. The high notes are full of love. I wish I were a phenomenal singer. I will definitely be singing to myself all the time.

The melody sounds all flowy. It comes from my heart. I wish she could hear it. I feel like I'm not doing enough. I am fumbling up my chances of connecting because I may be misinterpreted.

And yet I dance. The music gently caresses my dancing limbs. I'm happily dreaming. It costs nothing. My love just accepted dancing with me in the moonlight. Everything's perfect, and nothing can go sideways. It remains a dream for now. The sweetest candy with the consistency of a cloud.

Is it delicious? My brain is imagining the taste of a shape. But I'm eating nothing.

Why does it feel like that? Damn it. I'm eager to tell her. Yet I fear that expressing my intentions will make her flinch. And our paths may start drifting apart.

I express emotions instead of intentions. Maybe it works better. Perhaps music will connect the two of us.

## That Smile

We were talking, and she was smiling from cheek to cheek. That smile is something out of this world. She doesn't realize how hypnotic it is. She could use her smile to make everyone fall for her like a siren. It's beyond seductive.

She's generous, and I'm impressed by her selflessness.
