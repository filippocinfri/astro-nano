[Sooo this is love </br> Sooo this is what makes life divine </br> I'm all aglow, mm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz4YaMr1rlo) ðŸŽ¶

I am in love.

I am mourning this sweet melody with my mouth closed while writing. The high notes are full of love. I wish I was a phenomenal singer. I will definitely be singing to myself all the time.

The melody sounds all flowy. It comes from my heart. I wish she could hear it.

That is where problems begin: me wishing. It perfectly sums me up. Hidden behind a pseudonym, I am fumbling up my chances of connecting because I may be misunderstood.

And yet I dance. The music gently tickles my dancing limbs. I'm happily dreaming. It costs nothing. She can't refuse me a dance in the moonlight. Everything's perfect, and nothing can go sideways. Yet it will remain a dream forever. The sweetest candy with the consistency of a cloud.

Is it delicious? No, I'm eating nothing. The brain is imagining the taste of a shape. And I'm hungry.

Why does it feel like so? Damn it. I'm hungry to tell her. Yet I fear that expressing my intentions will make her flinch. And our paths may start drifting afar.

I express emotions instead of intentions. Maybe it works better. Perhaps music will reveal my human side.
