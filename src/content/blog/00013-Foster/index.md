It's the story of how an environment can foster talent to grow and achieve their dreams.

It's also the story of Ahmed. Our relationship is born with the rapidity of a fire spreading like wildfire, like two magnets placed over the line of attraction. Instant click.

Our first encounter was outstanding. We instantly bond. We agreed on everything. We moved similarly. Everything felt right. We also shared the same dream.

We both dreamt of making it through the Olympics. We wanted to win in the high jump. Imagine the feeling of flying in the air for seconds. One big push and the obstacle disappears. Imagine people chanting your name at each jump.

In retrospect, it was a dream bigger than myself. But I believed in it.

Our story was bound from the start. The extraordinary attracting force at the beginning is the same that repelled us later.

I leave you to the story; there are dreams at stake.

## Him

I won't be neutral about him. My future career was at stake. Please have pity for us, we both lost a friend.

We often joked and chatted between training sessions. Talking to Ahmed is a strange experience. You seem to hear multiple voices. Was he really one?

There were no problems during training. We trained hard. We trained consistently.

Watching him leave after each session was a bit weird. I eyed Ahmed (or every one of him) leaving after training for a long time. He weaseled out, trying to leave unnoticed. Always behaving like that. Maybe he was hiding a secret. I'm still wrapping my head around that. How is it possible that all these people leaving went overlooked?

Joseph Stalin said, "A single departure is a tragedy; a million departures are a statistic." Kind of. I'm not sure exactly.

## And I

The competitions went pretty well. We both won. Our relationship was going well, apart from the strange peculiarity of him being many.

The more we won, the higher the level of competition. The level was higher not only with others but also between us. The price we paid to train was high. Sometimes, it felt like I was paying a fee every time I entered. But the service was good. It was the price of two metro rides.

What's this strange feeling I had? I thought he had to pay more because Ahmed was not just one person. But He was good at jumping. He always paid less.

Why was the environment enabling such disparity? Maybe it was a Darwinian-like mechanism trying to eliminate the weakest jumpers.

But I was determined to prove my worth in the next competition.

We went there together. I paid to reach the place. Ahmed didn't. I was envious of the situation. I wanted to be a bit of a showoff on the way to the competition. I wanted to state my dominance clearly from the beginning. I was going to jump the ticket barrier to show him he was not a jumper at heart.

I was going to jump so high he had to remain speechless. It would be a jump so clean and so beautiful he would be envious for once.

I was ready. I started my run.

He was already on the other side. They had already jumped on the other side. He was elegant. They were all cunning.

The environment is going to foster all of them. A generation of jumpers is free of travel expenses all because a damn scientist discovered natural selection.

## Beware

Beware, reader. Looking for the hidden meaning will break the magic spell I cast on the words.
