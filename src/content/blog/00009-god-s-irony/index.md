The French high-wire artist. He's walking on a 3-centimeter wide wire suspended at 400 meters (1,312 feet) between the twin towers.

Impressive. Outstanding balancing skills. Death's waiting on the right and on the left.

Like my namesake, I am doing a dangerous walk on a small thread.

I want to capture God's sense of humor. On my left, bored readers because of a blunt post. A step on the right, and I offend God and Christians. The line separating dull jokes from profanity is on the atomic scale.

## God the Entrepreneur

God created men. He modeled mud with his own hands to create humankind. I suspect God purposely left some flaws. Almost like he didn't put in all the effort. In the end, we are his most prestigious creation. I was expecting a bit more from him.

By making us unwise, we need rules of good behavior. Christians explicitly point out the good and the evil.

Jesus basically created the customers: humans needing guidance. Then, he provided the product solving the needs: the Bible. This is Entrepreneurship 101. Well done. The Bible is the best-selling book of all time. Sounds like God is ready for an IPO.

## Deaf men

We have already established that humans are flawed.

However, not satisfied with the final product, God made men a bit more flawed than women. Men are deaf and distracted.

Knowing it, God chose to repeat himself twice. To avoid excuses of men not paying attention and not hearing his teachings.

Men. Beware:

- "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife."
- "Thou shalt not commit adultery."

God had only ten slots available. But he reiterated twice to make sure men did not cheat. God knows we are cheaters. And he wants to be sure.

After writing that God made us flawed on purpose and he needs reassurance that we don't cheat like a fresh girlfriend, I apologize.

These are jokes. Take the post with the light, funny tone it is intended.
