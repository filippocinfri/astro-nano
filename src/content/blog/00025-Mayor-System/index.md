Read the previous post (Mayor Effect) first to comprehend this post.

I am concerned that the widespread presence of the Mayor Effect will turn our current system into a Mayor System. The Mayor System is a bureaucratic system characterized by systematic sloth concerning road repairs. Beware that road works are just an example; different issues with a similar structure can still cause the Mayor Effect, and hence result in a Mayor System.

The Mayor System discourages or hinders other people from making repairs. People will lose faith that road repairs will ever work. A way to detect such systems is to check the incentives. What do the incentives align with? Fixing the issue with a healthy involvement of every level of the system, or are they aligned with pleasing the people in power?

Everyone enjoys nice roads. In Mayor systems, people have no faith that the roads will be fixed. They can't fix the roads themselves. So, people may resort to inviting the mayor or the governor to have their roads fixed quickly. Some people may decide to leave the city altogether.

The governor can only visit a certain number of cities; he is a limited resource. The reader may have guessed the consequences of such scarcity again: it tends to turn the system into a nepotistic and bribery system.
