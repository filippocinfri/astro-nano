Read the Mayor Effect (previous post) first to understand this post.

I am concerned that the widespread presence of the Mayor Effect will evolve our current system into a Mayor System.

The Mayor System is a bureaucratic system characterized by the systematic laziness of road repair. Remember that road repairs and road works are examples. You can have a Mayor Effect, and hence a Mayor System, where the same applies to a different issue. The Mayor System discourages or hinders other people from making repairs. People will lose faith that road repairs will ever work.

The only way to notice such systems is to check the incentives. Do they align with a healthy involvement of every level of the structure to fix the issue, or are they aligned with pleasing people? (Mostly pleasing the people in power)

People enjoy nice roads. In such systems, they have no faith that the roads will be fixed; they can't fix the roads themselves. So, they may resort to inviting the mayor or the governor to have their roads fixed quickly. Some people may decide to leave the city altogether.

The governor can only visit a certain number of cities; he is a limited resource. The reader may have guessed the consequences of such scarcity again: it tends to turn the system into a nepotistic and bribery system.
