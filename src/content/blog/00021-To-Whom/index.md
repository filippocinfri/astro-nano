In the previous post, I talked about love.

I don't want to talk about death.

But I came across an admirable story about love, death, and sanctity.

[Massimiliano Maria Kolbe](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/it/homilies/1982/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19821010_canonizzazione-kolbe.html).

It's the story of a saint who asserted, in a place of death, the right to life of an innocent man. What does all this have to do with love? No one has greater love than to give one's life for one's friends.

To whom am I willing to give my life?

I've asked the difficult question. Now it's time for me to think about the answer.
