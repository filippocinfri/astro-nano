Although I don't like being vulgar, that's the best title I could think of.

For some people, saying it to someone's face can feel immensely liberating. And I get it. Some people can be frustrating.

I've recently seen Chris Nikia's interview. A pretty big boy with Down syndrome speaking about how it feels to grow up with the syndrome. His friends, the school, and the difficulties he encountered.

He's an adult now, and the interview shows him doing an Ironman. He completes it. Not even the medal around his neck, the first image after the finish line is him giving a big hug to his guide.

Outstanding beyond conceivable levels.

After annoying questions, the interview ends with the following question.

What do you say to people who say that you can't do something?
"Fuck you."

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

That's not what he said. He had every right to. A life lived with frustrating difficulties, and he has already completed the Ironman. What else do you want? How dare you ask the question?

I must bow before Chris. He answered: "The first thing that comes out of my mouth is: I'm going to prove you wrong."
It spells clearly: I proved you wrong, I have no problem doing it time and time again in the face of any adversity.

This one is the most elegant answer I've ever heard. Fuck you, Chris. And I must say, this answer, coming from someone who truly walks the talk, tastes even better.

For my readers: People with Down syndrome often have terrible balance. It's troublesome when you have miles to bike and miles to run. He did have balance problems, he had heart surgery, he had other health problems, yet he accomplished what others don't even dream of doing.

He **DID** what ordinary people **WOULDN'T DREAM OF**. Let that sink in.

And he went for a hug before the hard-earned medal. He cares more for the people on his journey than for his achievements.
