I wrote a post, '[Human](/blog/00012-human/)', which tells a story deeply characterized by human emotions and what makes us human. And how relentlessly beautiful it is.

I've met R again. She's still uniquely human in a beautiful way. However, I fear that some words may not have retained the same meanings.

Genuine, plastic, sincere, caring, helpful, and shared were all concepts attached to the word 'human'. Being human meant not being perfect or invincible, but capable of greatness and selfless enough not to obtain things at others' expense. It meant being a contributing member of society, actually concerned about the whole. And, doing all that with human shareable feelings and emotions capable of inspiring, entertaining, or making others laugh or cry.

Now I feel the word 'human' is slowly and steadily leaning toward egoism, fallibility, and uselessness.
