I intend to recount here the day I lost my innocence. It happened recently, when I noticed the "Mayor Effect" twice in a day.

The effect takes its name from a person in a position of authority, such as a mayor or a governor. The Mayor Effect is the funny coincidence of which roads are being fixed or redone when the governor is visiting a place. Usually, the works take place exactly on the roads along the mayor's route to the destination, despite other roads having more severe problems or the problems on such roads have been known for ages. And coincidentally, the roads along the route happen to be fixed just before the mayor needs to use them.

The effect is not only restricted to roads, but it may also refer to other things, as long as the same principle of concealing everyday bothering little problems from the person in power is maintained.

The Mayor Effect hides the problems from the people who have the power to fix them. The timing of the effect conveys the message that Mayors (or power-haves) should not be affected by normal people's problems because they deserve more for the position they occupy.
