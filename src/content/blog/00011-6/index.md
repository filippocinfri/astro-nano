Time's in a hurry.

Donâ€™t blink. <br>
You'll miss the story.

## 6

Reservation expires in a few minutes. Three friends, six presents to open.

Tic.

Christmas is coming. But dinner's coming first. It all comes down to not delaying the plan deliberately.

Tic.

But the sacred tradition imposes exchanging presents.

Tic.

Indecisiveness. Nobody wants to break the plan. It's peak hour. Arriving late means risking not eating.

Tic.

Decision taken. Stay in the car.

Tic.

No time left to explain why. Times dilated.

Tic.

## 5

Five presents left. Another MAGA hat. You blinked. You missed the first.

Tic.

Both laugh. The scene is funny. The card was the protagonist.

Tic.

The card is curated. Care is perceived. Delivering Details requires time. Perceiving is quicker than explaining. Skip.

Tic.

Reference and jokes come flowing. Time comes flowing.

Tic.

## 4

The first mate is done. Fast. Second's turn.

Tic.

Another hat. It's the kind of hat carrying too many stereotypes to tell.

Tic.

## 3

A book. A story outside the book.

Tic.

The story is false. It was just for fun.

Tic.

Details hide in the wrap. Stop.

Tic.

## 2

Third friend.

Tic.

A personalized shirt appears behind a cryptic Christmas message.

Tic.

Payback for the curated card.

Tic.

## 1

A hat to cover a balding head. A message covering the illegal hat.

Tic.

Not any hat. A personalized hat.

Tic.

Personalized enough to make it jail-worthy.

Tic.

<br>

They can now enjoy dinner.

<br><br><br>

In peace. Finally.

<br><br><br><br><br>

It takes time to enjoy a dinner together. That was the intent.
