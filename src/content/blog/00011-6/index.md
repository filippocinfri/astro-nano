Time's in a hurry.

Don’t blink.
You'll miss the story.

## 6

Reservation expires in a few minutes. Three friends, six presents to open.

Tic.

Christmas is coming. But dinner's coming first. It all comes down to not delaying the plan deliberately.

Tic.

But the sacred tradition imposes exchanging presents.

Tic.

Indecisiveness puts everything at risk. It's peak hour. Arriving late means almost certainly not eating.

Tic.

Decision taken. Stay in the car.

Tic.

No time left to explain why. Times dilated.

Tic.

## 5

Five presents left. Another MAGA hat. You blinked. You missed the first.

Tic.

Both laugh. The scene is funny. The greeting card was the actual protagonist.

Tic.

The card is curated. Details reveal care. Delivering every detail requires time. Perceiving is quicker than explaining. Skip.

Tic.

Reference and jokes come flowing. Time comes flowing.

Tic.

## 4

The first mate is done. Fast. Second's turn.

Tic.

Another hat. It's the kind of hat carrying too many stereotypes to tell.

Tic.

## 3

A book. A story outside the book.

Tic.

The story is false. It was just for fun.

Tic.

Details hide in the wrap. Stop.

Tic.

## 2

Third friend.

Tic.

A personalized shirt appears behind a cryptic Christmas message.

Tic.

Payback for the curated card.

Tic.

## 1

A hat to cover a balding head. A message covering the illegal hat.

Tic.

Not any hat. A personalized hat.

Tic.

Personalized enough to make it jail-worthy.

Tic.

<br>

They can now enjoy dinner.

<br><br><br>

In peace. Finally.

<br><br><br><br><br>

I've enjoyed the dinner. That was the intent.
