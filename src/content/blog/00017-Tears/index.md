I'm in an oversharing mood.

When was the last time I cried?

I want to talk about the last four times I cried. You will probably know a lot about me at this point.

## 1

I cried because of the death of a dog. A dog that filled my life with joy. He was a bit of a rascal, but his love was unconditional. He suffered before dying, and I wasn't there when he passed. I will never forgive myself. I cried a lot. I stopped after some time. And then sobbed again for most of my day.

## 2

I cried because my mother was crying. We were both crying with joy. Seeing my mother crying has me weak at my knees. Her selflessness bursting out in a cry is something that I can't properly articulate.
I wish I dared to tell her all this to her face instead of writing about it.

## 3

I cried when I finally achieved something hard.
Lots of hard work, sweat, and tears. All alone, doing my best to achieve something outstanding. At the finish line, it was so sweet looking back at it that I wasn't able to keep the tears from flowing down.

## 4

I cried because of a book. A romantic novel? No. A pestered biography? No. A violent tale? No.
It was an innocent essay. Describing how some historic figures sharing a common dream were shaping history. I felt it.
I had the same dream, and I didn't know them. They were stranger to me. Not anymore, now I feel strangely connected to them. I feel like I'm contributing to something bigger than me. I'm carrying on the legacy others started.
It is a dream of peace. Everyone lives well when there is peace. I can see something way bigger than me finally become achievable.
