I am an engineer.

I'm passionate about history and specifically about technological progress throughout history.

Recently, I was able to witness the precise moment an inventor set a new milestone. She pushed the technology forward, beyond comprehensible limits, of an everyday object like a frame.

I have many photos, most of which are in a wooden frame with protective glass in front. Frames have always been this way. Cheaper ones may use plastic for the borders instead of wood.

She, the inventor, decided with a fabulous perspective revolution that a whole church would be the frame of her cheek's photo. Centuries went by with only small wooden frames eclipsed by a single moment of a brilliant paradigm shift.

What an idiot I am. I was taking pictures of the skilled craftsmanship of the works of art and the impressive composition of the architect instead of my butt.

Art is now the frame.
