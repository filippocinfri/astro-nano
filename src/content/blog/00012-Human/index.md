I hand over my phone.

_Click click_.<br>
She starts reading.<br>
She seems interested.<br>
"I will continue later."

Suddenly, I'm perplexed. R was caught up reading my post. Why did she stop abruptly? I was assuming the worst-case scenario. I may have written something perceived as either toxic or dull, and she was providing an excuse to stop.

Maybe it could have been the situation. There were other people; she might have thought reading was inappropriate then. Curious, I asked her: "Why later? You don't like it?".

She answered, "I'm going to make myself a sobbing mess." It was a genuinely felt reply. I had no way of doubting that it was the truth. It blew me away. I was speechless. Strong emotions were building up while she was reading [Happiness and Granted Things](/blog/00007-happiness-granted-things/).

Human
She quit reading before the growing knot in her stomach could embarrass her. She was honest with her feelings. It's hard to be honest with your feelings in front of others. It may feel vulnerable. Some boldness on her side.

Later, she revealed why the stomach knot. She confessed to me she had experiences similar to mine. The post brought up memories.

Emotions are peculiarly human. They are intuitive, and we are all capable of feeling them. It's wonderful when others perceive the same feelings I intended to write. This will forever amaze me.

It's impressive in a way I find difficult to articulate. It's incredibly human, and it makes me feel connected to othersâ€”a real connection, a bond with the readers.

It's also powerful. Feelings to words to feelings again. The essence of something deep and personal, like feelings and emotions, doesn't lose meaning during the translation. From my head to some static words in a blog. Then again, in the mind of somebody else. Perhaps in their hearth.

I hope. That's the magic that pushes me to keep writing.
