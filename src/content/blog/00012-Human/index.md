_She starts reading_ <br>

"I will continue later."

I'm perplexed. R started reading my post enthusiastically. Why did she stop suddenly? I'm assuming the worst-case scenario where I've messed up. I may have written something perceived as harmful. Or something boring, and she was providing an excuse to stop. Or maybe it could have been the situation. There were other people; she might have found reading inappropriate at that moment. <br>
I want to understand. "Why? You don't like it?"

"I'm going to make myself a sobbing mess." It was a genuinely felt reply. I have no way of doubting that it was nothing but the truth.

It left me speechless. What follows is a night reflection of what happened.

## Human

She started reading [Happiness and Granted Things](/blog/00007-happiness-granted-things/). She stopped before the growing knot in her stomach could put her in an embarrassing situation. It's hard to be honest with your feelings in front of others. You may feel vulnerable. The boldness left me wordless.

Later, she confessed to me she had experiences similar to mine. The post brought them up again.

Emotions are a human thing. It's wonderful when others perceive the feelings and emotions in my posts. It will never stop amazing me.

It's impressive in a way I find difficult to articulate. It's incredibly human, and it makes me feel connected to others. A real connection. A bond with the readers.

It's also powerful. Feelings to words to feelings again. The essence of something deep and personal, like feelings and emotions, doesn't lose meaning during the translation. From my head to some static words in a blog. Then again, in the mind of somebody else. Perhaps in their hearth.

I hope. That's the magic that pushes me to keep writing.
